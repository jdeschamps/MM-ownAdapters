We use this device adapter to switch from internal to external sensors using a focus-locking system. The focus-locking system uses a 785 nm laser beam reflected in TIRF on a coverslip and 
detected by a quadrant photo-diode to compensate for axial drift. The QPD electronics sends a 0-10 V signal to the analog input of a E-709 stage controller (PI). The signal corresponds to -1/+1 um (internal parameters).
Our z stage is a P-726 (PI).

:warning: The device adapter sets some internal controller parameter values. These values might be only safe for our z stage. Please contact PI or your device manufacturer to the exact procedure to switch from internal to external sensor (and inversely). ​Us​e​ th​i​s ​d​e​vi​ce ​a​dap​te​r ​a​t ​y​o​ur​ ​ow​n ​ri​sk​.​ :warning:
